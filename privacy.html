          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Aught Hour LLC (“Aught Hour,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our websites, programs, and products, including initiatives such as Bell AI Fellowship and TaskCloud (together, the “Services”).</p>

        <div id="collect" class="policy-section">
          <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect basic identifiers such as your name, email address, and phone number to enable voice, SMS, or account-related features. We also collect interaction data, including messages, call audio, transcripts, AI chat logs, and feedback you provide while using the Services. We gather usage data such as your device type, browser, general location (city or region), pages visited, features used, and timestamps to help us understand and improve performance.

        </div>

        <div id="voice" class="policy-section">
          <h2>6. Voice, SMS and Phone Numbers</h2>
